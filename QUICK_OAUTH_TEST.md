# Quick Google OAuth Test

## Test if Google OAuth is Working

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser console** (F12) and go to: http://localhost:3000/auth

3. **Click "Continue with Google"** and check the console for errors

## Expected Behavior vs Current Issue

### ‚úÖ **What Should Happen**:
- Click "Continue with Google" ‚Üí Redirect to Google OAuth page
- User signs in with Google ‚Üí Redirect back to your app
- User is logged in successfully

### ‚ùå **What's Happening Now**:
- Click "Continue with Google" ‚Üí Nothing happens or error
- This means Google OAuth is not configured in Supabase

## Immediate Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Supabase Google Provider Status
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xccuofiagrvfrtkuviro/auth/providers
2. Look for Google provider
3. Is it **enabled**? (should show green toggle)

### Step 2: If Google Provider is Disabled
1. Click **Configure** on Google provider
2. You'll need to add:
   - **Client ID** (from Google Cloud Console)
   - **Client Secret** (from Google Cloud Console)

### Step 3: If Google Provider is Enabled but Not Working
1. Check the **Redirect URL** in Supabase
2. It should be: `https://xccuofiagrvfrtkuviro.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

## Quick Test Without Google OAuth

If you want to test the app immediately:

1. **Use Email/Password**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/auth
   - Click "Sign Up" tab
   - Create account with email and password
   - Test the core functionality

2. **The app works perfectly without Google OAuth** - it's just an additional login option

## Next Steps

1. **Test with email/password first** to verify the app works
2. **Configure Google OAuth** when you have time
3. **Both login methods will work** once Google OAuth is set up

The core idea validation features don't depend on Google OAuth - it's just a convenience feature! üöÄ
